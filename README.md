# Camera and Curls

![Picture of the website on different devices](image-url)

I decided to build a portfolio to showcase my photography and provide a means of contact for people that would like to collaborate. You are able to visit this [here](https://sian504.github.io/camera_and_curls/).

## Business Goals

The business goals for the portfolio are as follows:

1. Showcase Work and Build a Strong Brand Presence: The primary goal of the portfolio website is to showcase my best photography. It allows me to present my unique style and creativity while also helping to build a strong brand presence on social media.

2. Attract Potential Collaborators: A well-curated portfolio website can attract potential collaborators. Creatives looking for photographers often search for portfolios to evaluate the photographer's skills and suitability for their specific needs.

3. Show Progress and Growth: The portfolio website will act as a timeline of my progress and growth over time. It allows viewers to see how my style has evolved, building a narrative around my artistic journey.

## First Time User Stories

- As a first time user, I want to see a visually appealing portfolio, so I can quickly understand the photographer's style.
- As a first time user, I want to navigate a clear and intuitive portfolio, so I can easily explore different sections, such as the photographer's different categories of work and their contact page.
- As a first time user, I want to view high-quality images in a responsive image gallery, so I can enjoy the photographer's work on any device without sacrificing image quality.

## Returning User Stories

- As a returning user, I want to see new additions to the photographer's portfolio, so I can stay updated with their latest work and creative projects.
- As a returning user, I want to access the photographer's social media links, so I can follow their updates on different platforms and share their work with my network.
- As a returning user, I want to access the photographer's contact page so I can give feedback and ask about a potential collaboration.

## UX

I designed the portfolio using the core principles of UX. I used this framework to think about my target users and what features would be present on the website.

## Strategy

Camera and Curls is aimed at the following users:

- Art Enthusiasts: People who appreciate fine art photography and may be interested in purchasing prints or supporting your artistic endeavors.
- Potential Collaborators: Other artists, photographers, or creative professionals who may be interested in collaborating on joint projects or exhibitions.
- Fans and Followers: Individuals who are interested in your work, follow you on social media, and regularly engage with your photography content.
- Students and Aspiring Photographers: Individuals interested in learning more about photography techniques, styles, and artistic vision.

These users would be looking for the following:

- Responsive Design: The website should be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Intuitive Navigation: A user-friendly navigation menu and clear layout help users find what they're looking for easily. A logical hierarchy and straightforward navigation enhance the overall browsing experience.
- Contact Form: Users should easily find contact information or a contact form to inquire about collaborations or other inquiries.
- Image Gallery and Slideshow: A visually appealing image gallery or slideshow feature allows users to view photographs in an engaging and immersive manner.

I wanted to keep the portfolio simple and sleek as well as intuitive. I wanted the photographs presented in the best possible way so that the user was able to understand my photographic style right away.


## Scope

To achieve the business goals and user requirements, I will be including the following features:

- Header and menu that allows users to navigate through all pages of the portfolio
- A visually appealing slideshow of some selected images
- Portfolio page arranged in chronological order
- Contact page for potential collaborators and fan enquiries
- Links to social media pages


## Structure

The website will consist of 3 pages:

1. Home page
2. Portfolio page
3. Contact form for users who would like to request to work together on a creative project

These pages will be contained in a navigation bar that will appear at the top of each page so that the user is able to navigate easily through all sections of the site. The order of the navigation bar appears in order of priority Home > Portfolio > Contact. I believe this is a natural progression for the user and a layout that will allow them to enjoy the photos best.

The homepage will consist of a visually appealing slideshow of some of my photos along with a short About Me section so that they are able to find out some information about the photographer. All text blocks will be minimal to not distract the user from the images. The portfolio section will allow the user to delve deeper into different categories of photos that I have taken. These will be arranged by the countries they were taken in, in chronological order, so that they are able to see the progression in my ability and style. The contact form will consist of a hero image of a selected photo with a form that allows users to leave their contact details and leave feedback or request to be contacted about a potential collaboration.

## Surface

The website will be presented with a black background throughout with the exception of the contact page, which will feature a hero image of a selected photo in the background with a contact form layered over the top of it. The reason for the black background choice is to ensure that the photos will visually stand out. The nav bar will be a contrasting color with an image of me in the top left corner of the screen. The text will be white to contrast the dark color of the background to allow users to read the about me section clearly.

I will be using Playfair Display for the headings and Montserrat for the body. By using this font pairing, my portfolio website will have a cohesive and polished appearance, while still allowing your images to take center stage.

## Credits 

[Homepage design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3NNBnSA3C4) This website helped me in particular with the linear gradient of the background colour. I felt this added more style to the website over the original black background.
